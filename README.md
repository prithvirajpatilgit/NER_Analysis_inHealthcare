### Consider a hypothetical health tech company,  which aims to connect medical communities with millions of patients through a web platform. The platform enables doctors to list their services, manage patient interactions, and provide services such as booking appointments and ordering medicines online. Using this platform, doctors can easily organize appointments, track a patient’s past medical records, and provide e-prescriptions.

### Companies generate large volumes of data by providing medical services, prescriptions, and online consultations. Let’s take a look at the following snippet of medical data that may be generated when a doctor writes notes to their patient or prepares reviews of their patient.

### “The patient was a 62-year-old man with squamous cell lung cancer, which was first successfully treated by a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.” 

### Note: You are required to complete the assignment on the Google Collab notebook, so you need to download the data set and then upload it to the required Google Drive folder to read it in your respective notebook.

### you need to process four data sets: train_sent   test_sent  train_label  test_label

### You are required to process and modify the given data into the sentence format. You need to do this for the “train_sent” and “train_label” data sets and for test data sets.
### Next, you need to define the features to build the CRF model.
### Further, you must apply these features in each sentence in the train and test data set to get the feature values.
### Once the features are computed, you need to define the target variable and then build the CRF model.
### Next, you need to evaluate the model's performance using the test data set.
### Finally, you are required to create a dictionary in which diseases are the keys and treatments are the values.
